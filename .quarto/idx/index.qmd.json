By profiling **linear and curvilinear sprint ability**—and how athletes apply force in these contexts—we can drive a cultural shift toward scientifically grounded base running development: turning data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into best practice.\n\n## Research highlights\n\n<div class=\"cards\">\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n<div class=\"card-title\">Curvilinear Ability Test (CAT)</div>\n<div class=\"card-text\">Field-based assessment to quantify curvilinear sprinting + change-of-direction performance specific to baseball/softball.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n<div class=\"card-title\">MLB StatCast / Hawk-Eye profiling</div>\n<div class=\"card-text\">Normative KPI values across MLB and evidence that linear sprint metrics alone don’t explain multi-base running success.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n<div class=\"card-title\">Applied diagnostics</div>\n<div class=\"card-text\">Wearable + tracking-informed evaluation to guide training decisions, performance, and injury-risk management.</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n## Selected writing\n\n- [Browse all articles →](articles.qmd)\n- [Read blogs →](notes.qmd)\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Background (extended bio)</strong></summary>\n\nJosé Antonio Martínez-Rodríguez PhD(c), MExSc, CSCS,*D is internationally recognized for the development of the Curvilinear Ability Test (CAT), a novel field-based assessment designed to quantify curvilinear sprinting and change-of-direction performance specific to baseball and softball.
