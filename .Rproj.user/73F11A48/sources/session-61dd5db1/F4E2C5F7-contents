title: "Introduction to an advanced change of direction test in baseball and softball: The curvilinear ability test"

date: 2024-06

description: "Baseball and softball base running involve appropriate body position and maximal sprinting that may require curvilinear sprinting and subsequent changes of direction depending on the situational context. Traditionally, the pro-agility test has been used in baseball and softball to evaluate agility performance. When evaluating the specific tests that could be used to record change of direction speed (CODS) time in base running, it is advised to record not only the total time to complete the test but also to record the time to complete each running segment because this will provide greater information about the CODS strengths and weaknesses for each athlete. Furthermore, it is important to consider whether an additional test integrating curvilinear and CODS characteristics to simulate base running provides further objective data to evaluate base running ability. This article introduces a new field assessment called the Curvilinear Ability Test (CAT) that measures both curvilinear and CODS properties in base running. The CAT is believed to provide greater assessment value versus the pro-agility and 505 agility tests in evaluating base running ability."
