  Curvilinear sprinting requires unique biomechanical adaptations that differ significantly from linear sprinting. By understanding the forces and muscle activation patterns involved in running curves, athletes can train more effectively and reduce injury risks. Mastering these mechanics is essential for baseball players to improve base-running efficiency and overall performance. With targeted strength and technique training, players can build the stability, power, and coordination necessary to excel in curved trajectories, enhancing both their athletic potential and durability on the field.
