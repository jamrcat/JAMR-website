### The need for speed: Linear and curvilinear characteristics in MLB players

A game-derived profile of base running KPIs using StatCast/Hawk-Eye data, with implications for assessing curvilinear sprint ability beyond linear speed metrics.

## About

I am a doctoral researcher in Sport and Exercise Science at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and a member of the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand (SPRINZ). My work focuses on advancing base running performance in baseball through data-driven, sport-specific assessment and training—particularly the often-overlooked demands of **curvilinear sprinting** in game contexts.

## Base Running Science

Base Running Science is my long-term professional project: an independent, evidence-based framework centered on how athletes **maintain speed through curvilinear paths** during real game situations while running multiple bases. The goal is to support organizations, academies, practitioners, and players through collaboration, education, and the application of base running diagnostics and exercise prescription.

## Why it matters

Base running performance directly impacts baseball outcomes, yet it remains one of the least studied and integrated movement domains in the sport. By profiling **linear and curvilinear sprint ability**—and how athletes apply force in these contexts—we can drive a cultural shift toward scientifically grounded base running development: turning data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into best practice.

<summary><strong>Background (extended bio)</strong></summary>

José Antonio Martínez-Rodríguez PhD(c), MExSc, CSCS,*D is internationally recognized for the development of the Curvilinear Ability Test (CAT), a novel field-based assessment designed to quantify curvilinear sprinting and change-of-direction performance specific to baseball and softball. Complementing this applied innovation, he has contributed original research using MLB StatCast and Hawk-Eye data, establishing updated normative values for base running performance across Major League Baseball and demonstrating that linear sprint metrics alone fail to explain multiple base running success.

His academic foundation includes a Master of Exercise Science (Exercise Physiology) from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus, with competencies in experimental design, statistical analysis, and applied sport physiology. José is also a CSCS,*D and has experience with wearable technologies for diagnostics, including IMU foot pod systems and GPS.

Beyond research, José is committed to capacity building and leadership within Puerto Rico's sport science and sport medicine community. His leadership philosophy emphasizes empowering emerging professionals to translate scientific data into applied practice and strengthening sport medicine–performance collaboration.

José’s long-term objective is to bridge base running science with applied baseball environments by contributing within an MLB organization or elite baseball academy—leading a shift toward scientifically grounded base running development.
